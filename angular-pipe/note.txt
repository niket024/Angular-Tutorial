Angular Pipes 
===============
Use pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, and other data for display. 
Pipes are simple functions you can use in template expressions to accept an input 
value and return a transformed value. 
Pipes are useful because you can use them throughout your application, while only declaring each pipe once.

Basically, pipes provide a sophisticated and handsome way to perform the tasks within the templates. 
Pipes make our code clean and structured.

Why Pipe Required?

In any application, Pipe can be needed to use as per the following reason â€“
We can display only some filtered elements from an array.
We can modify or format the value.
We can use them as a function.
We can do all of the above combined.

The most commonly used built-in pipes are:
Currency
Date
Uppercase
Lowercase
JSON
Decimal
Percent
Async
