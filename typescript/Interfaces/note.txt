TypeScript - Interfaces
----------------------
An interface is a syntactical contract that an entity should conform to. 
In other words, an interface defines the syntax that any entity must adhere to.

Interfaces define properties, methods, and events, which are the members of the interface. 
Interfaces contain only the declaration of the members. 
It is the responsibility of the deriving class to define the members. 
It often helps in providing a standard structure that the deriving classes would follow.

Interfaces and Inheritance
-------------------------
An interface can be extended by other interfaces. 
In other words, an interface can inherit from other interface. 
Typescript allows an interface to inherit from multiple interfaces.

Use the extends keyword to implement inheritance among interfaces.
