The break Statement
-------------------
The break statement is used to take the control out of a construct. 
Using break in a loop causes the program to exit the loop.

The continue Statement
--------------------
The continue statement skips the subsequent statements in the current 
iteration and takes the control back to the beginning of the loop. 

The Infinite Loop
---------------------
An infinite loop is a loop that runs endlessly. 
The for loop and the while loop can be used to make an endless loop.

for(;;) { 
   console.log(“This is an endless loop”) 
}

while(true) { 
   console.log(“This is an endless loop”) 
}
