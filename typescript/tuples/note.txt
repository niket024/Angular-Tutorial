TypeScript - Tuples
-------------------
At times, there might be a need to store a collection of values of varied types. 
Arrays will not serve this purpose. 
TypeScript gives us a data type called tuple that helps to achieve such a purpose.

It represents a heterogeneous collection of values. In other words, 
tuples enable storing multiple fields of different types. 
Tuples can also be passed as parameters to functions.
