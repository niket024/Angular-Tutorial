TypeScript - Union
------------------
TypeScript 1.4 gives programs the ability to combine one or two types. 
Union types are a powerful way to express a value that can be one of the several types. 
Two or more data types are combined using the pipe symbol (|) to denote a Union Type. 
In other words, a union type is written as a sequence of types separated by vertical bars.
