Angular 8 Services
===================
Angular Service contains the various methods and functions to manage the data arriving from the server.

Why Angular Service Class?
=========================
To handle the features that are separate from components such as authentication, CRUD operations.
To share the data among various components in an Angular app.
To make the Testing and Debugging simple.
To write the re-usable code to centrally organise the application.

What is Angular Service?
========================
Most of the time, we get into the situation where we need to use the same code again and again. 
Using repetitive code in multiple components becomes a headache.

When the size of an Angular application gets bigger, then It almost becomes difficult to 
manage the code base of our app. In this scenario,
the best practice will be to write the reusable code.

Creating Service Class
=======================
ng generate service Calc

@Injectable(): 
===============
Decorator that marks a class as available to be provided and injected as a dependency.

providedIn:
============
The metadata, providedIn: 'root', means that the Service is visible throughout the application.

Dependency injection in Angular
===============================
Dependencies are services or objects that a class needs to perform its function. Dependency injection, or DI, 
is a design pattern in which a class requests dependencies from external sources rather than creating them.

Angular's DI framework provides dependencies to a class upon instantiation. 
You can use Angular DI to increase flexibility and modularity in your applications.
