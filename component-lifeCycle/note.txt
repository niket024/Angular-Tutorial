Angular - Lifecycle Hooks
=========================
Angular application goes through an entire set of processes or has a 
lifecycle right from its initiation to the end of the application.

Following is a description of each lifecycle hook.

ngOnChanges − When the value of a data bound property changes, then this method is called.

ngOnInit − This is called whenever the initialization of the directive/component after 
Angular first displays the data-bound properties happens.

ngDoCheck − This is for the detection and to act on changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own.

ngAfterContentInit − This is called in response after Angular projects external content into the 
component's view.

ngAfterContentChecked − This is called in response after Angular checks the content projected into the 
component.

ngAfterViewInit − This is called in response after Angular initializes the component's views and child views.

ngAfterViewChecked − This is called in response after Angular checks the component's views and child views.

ngOnDestroy − This is the cleanup phase just before Angular destroys the directive/component.
