Data Binding in Angular 8
----------------------------
Data binding is the core concept of Angular 8 and used to define the communication 
between a component and the DOM. It is a technique to link your data to your view layer. 
In simple words, you can say that data binding is a communication between your typescript 
code of your component and your template which user sees. It makes easy to define interactive 
applications without worrying about pushing and pulling data.

Data binding can be either one-way data binding or two-way data binding.

One-way databinding
-------------------
One way databinding is a simple one way communication where HTML template is 
changed when we make changes in TypeScript code.
Or

In one-way databinding, the value of the Model is used in the View (HTML page) but you can't 
update Model from the View. Angular Interpolation / String Interpolation, Property Binding, 
and Event Binding are the example of one-way databinding.

Two-way databinding
----------------------
In two-way databinding, automatic synchronization of data happens between the 
Model and the View. Here, change is reflected in both components. Whenever you make changes in the Model, 
it will be reflected in the View and when you make changes in View, it will be reflected in Model.

This happens immediately and automatically, ensures that the HTML template and the 
TypeScript code are updated at all times.

Angular provides four types of data binding and they are different on the way of data flowing.

1. String Interpolation
2. Property Binding
3. Event Binding
4. Two-way binding


String interpolation
---------------------
String Interpolation is a one-way databinding technique which is used to output the data from a 
TypeScript code to HTML template (view). It uses the template expression in double curly braces to 
display the data from the component to the view.

For example:

{{ data }}

Property Binding
-----------------
Property Binding is also a one-way data binding technique. In property binding, 
we bind a property of a DOM element to a field which is a defined property in our component TypeScript code.

For example:

<img [src]="imgUrl"/>

Event Binding
--------------
In Angular 8, event binding is used to handle the events raised from the DOM like button click, 
mouse move etc. When the DOM event happens (eg. click, change, keyup), it calls the specified 
method in the component. In the following example, the cookBacon() method from the component is 
called when the button is clicked:

For example:

<button (click)="cookBacon()"></button>  

Two way Data Binding in Angular 8
=================================
We have seen that in one-way data binding any change in the template (view) were not be 
reflected in the component TypeScript code. To resolve this problem, Angular provides two-way data binding. 
The two-way binding has a feature to update data from component to view and vice-versa.

In two-way databinding, automatic synchronization of data happens between the Model and the View. Here, 
change is reflected in both components. Whenever you make changes in the Model, it will be reflected in 
the View and when you make changes in View, it will be reflected in Model.

This happens immediately and automatically, ensures that the HTML template and the TypeScript code are 
updated at all times.

first of all you need to import FormsModule in app.module.ts  
eg. import {FormsModule} from '@angular/forms';    
and also in import
eg.  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    FormsModule
  ],
